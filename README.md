#Project Flow 

A user Portfolio build with Rails. It Allows users to showcase their work history while providing links to its source code (i.e Github) . Suggests users Projects which have not been completed. Provides labels (i.e Rails, Ruby, Css etc) for project easy search by categories (soon to be implemented).
